JCMP Minimap Icons
=========================

A script to draw minimap icons for vehicles.

Red indicates destroyed vehicles.
Orange indicates occupied vehicles.
Yellow indicates unoccupied vehicles.

The code also has 3 white icons for each vehicle, but they are not used on the minimap, they are just there for reference.
